The application was developed in Python using Tkinter package. 

A brief explanation of each file is given:

	- GUI4.8.py contains the source code for the computer application
	- functions_cleanv9.py contains the developed python functions for the validation of univenly spaced flowrate timeseries
	- functions_forecastv6.py contains the developed python functions for the reconstruction of flowrate timeseries
	- helpv4.py contains the code for the help menu
	- _____.png contains the logos of the R&D team
	- Holidays.csv contains a list of holidays and can be edited by the user
	- SÃ©rie_teste_input.csv and Historico_15min_input.csv contains a raw timeseries and already processed flowrate timeseries. These files can be used to test the tool.
	- requirements_specific.txt contains the list of python libraries and its associated version

The Standalone software can be downloaded using the following link: https://wisdom.ips.pt/static/validts/WISDom_1.0.2.zip

The datasets folder contains the flowrate datasets from three water utilities and they were used in the development and validation stages.
